- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m @dianegoncalves
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, Web Development (frontend) and Design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cybersecurity.
- 💻 I have 5 years of professional experience in graphic design, where I also worked as an art finalist, photographer and website and social networking management, always with connection to digital marketing. I have a constant curiosity for new technologies, IT and programming, aiming to combine these same areas with design.
